					When you start running, don't plan to go too far or too fast right awayâ€”doing so
					is the number-one cause of injury among runners. Start by running for 20 minutes
					at a time, three times per week. Gradually increase the amount of time you're
					running and the number of days you run, but don't increase either until you feel
					comfortable completing your current level of training. If 20 minutes is too much,
					don't be afraid to take walking breaks. Perhaps begin by running for 4 minutes
					and walking for 1 minute, until you complete the 20 minutes. As you get stronger,
					begin eliminating the walk breaks.
					</p>

					When you're a beginner, don't worry about how many miles you're running. Focus
					on the number of minutes instead. Gradually you'll begin to cover more ground in
					the same amount of time, and that's when you'll want to increase the duration of
					your workout. (Following a plan like this Couch-to-5K Plan for Super Beginner
					Runners can help keep you accountable and help you ease in without going too
					hard, too fast.

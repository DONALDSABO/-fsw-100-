	LANGLEY ,VA-A reported released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the inspector General reveald that the
	CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with
	black highlighters.

	According to the report,sections of the documents--"almost invariably the most crucial passages"-are marred
	by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read,due to a top-secrect highlighting policy
	that began at the agency's inception in 1947.

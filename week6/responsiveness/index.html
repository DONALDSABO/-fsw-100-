					                    The ten essentials are the ten pieces of gear that every hiker should bring out when them on the trail, whether on a short hike or multi-month
			                            through hike. The ten essentials were invented in the 1930s to help people enjoy the outdoors safely. It was an era before helicopter
			                            evacuations and satellite beacons; the ten essentials were designed to help folks stay alive outside. Today the ten essentials still hold true at
			                            their core, but can be improved upon with the help of new gear and technology. Here’s my take on the hiking essentials; this is what I take on
			                            every hike and what you should too.
